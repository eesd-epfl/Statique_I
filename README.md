The first course of structural mechanics in any civil engineering curriculum introduces important principles, such as the free body diagram, static equilibrium and the internal forces in structural members, and then applies these principles to statically determinate systems. At EPFL, these concepts are taught in the course Statique I in the second semester of the Bachelor curriculum (BA2). This introductory course lays the foundation to many other civil engineering courses, and engineers in practice or research who design or analyse any type of structure need to have these techniques and concepts at their fingertips.

The idea behind this booklet is twofold: First, we want to reinforce these first principles taught in Statique I throughout the curriculum by applying them to systems treated in the BA3-6 courses that build on Statique I. The presented exercises can serve as a basis for self-study when preparing for a course or as a homework assignment in week 1 of a course. Second, this booklet is also intended to give Statique I students an idea of how the principles they are learning will be used in later courses and in engineering practice. For these purposes, we have put together a small set of exercises for each course that repeat important concepts and introduce others. In the future, we plan to expand this booklet with exercises on statically indeterminate systems, covered in Statique II. We would like to thank Prof Alain Nussbaumer for the exercises on steel structures, Dr Olivier Burdet for his input in general and for the exercises on concrete structures and bridges in particular, and Dr Giovanni Di Cesare for his help with the hydraulics exercises.
